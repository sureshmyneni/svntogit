I know that I'm running out of time
(I want it all, mmm, mmm)
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I get it all the way
(I want it all, mmm, mmm)
We can get 'em running, running, running
Just like fire, burning out the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, uh
And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm
See I…
